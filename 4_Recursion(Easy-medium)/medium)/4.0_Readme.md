_Definition_

Function calls itself to solve smaller versions of the same problem.

_Two Parts of Recursion_

1. _Base Case_ - stop condition (When to stop calling itself).
2. _Recursive Case_ - Part where function calls itself.

_Real Life Examples_

1. Queue of people
2. Comment Threads
3. Organisational Hierarchies


_Common Mistakes_

1. Missing Base case - leads to stack overflow
2. Not simplifying the input - never reaches the base case
3. Too deep recursion - large inputs
4. Keeping in mind the time complexity


_When to use recursion_

1. Problem can be broken into sub problems
2. Trees & graphs
3. Backtracking, DP, Divide & Conquer
