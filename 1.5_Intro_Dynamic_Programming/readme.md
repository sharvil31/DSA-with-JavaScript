*Dynamic Programming [DP]*

1. Created by Richard Beuman in 1950s.
2. It is an optimization technique which used in Maths.
3. In its early days it used to find optimal solutions to develop ballistic missiles in cold war.
4. Today it is used in Google Maps, DNA matching-alignment algorithms, stock market predictions, video games, AI, etc.
5. DP says dont repeat yourself. Why do the hardwork again when you can store once and reuse.

* Definition *

DP is an optimization technique used to solve problems that can be broken down into *overlapping subproblems* that have an *optimal substructure*.

- Overlaping Subproblems - While solving a big problem, we repeatedily solve same smaller problems again and again.
- Optimal Substructure - The solution to the big problem can be constructed from solution of smaller subproblems.


"DP is all about storing and reusing the results of smaller subproblems, instead of recalculating again."


Note - Before learning DP you need to understand *Recursion*. Because recursion problems are optimized using DP. You should be good at *Recursion* before learning DP.
